Description: Simple blacklisting DNS proxy
 Dns-filter is a simple DNS proxy that returns NXDOMAIN if the master
 offers an IP from a specified blacklist.
 .
 This is useful for broken ISPs that have an obnoxious and RFC violating
 "The page you were looking for cannot be found" website for all
 unregistered domains, and you don't want to install and configure Bind
 or djbdns.
